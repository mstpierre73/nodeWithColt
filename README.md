#nodeWithColt
In this course, I learned to use NodeJS to make a dynamic application. I set a server using Express and a RESTfull API (with CRUD operations). I used EJS template to create dynamic web pages and JSON to get data from external API. I learned to use MongoDB as a No-SQL database and mongoose to easily manage DB operations. Finaly, I learned to use Passport authentication to manage users permissions.

The final project is the YelpCamp project, who is a dynamic app for campgrounds recommandations. This project use Google Maps API and some others librairies like moment.js, connect-flash, nodemon, and passport. In this app, a user can create a profile, and when logged, create new campgrounds or make comments on existing campgrounds. He can modify and delete his comments and campgrounds and flash message inform the user of the success or failure of his actions. All users actions have a timestamp. The campgrounds info page is filled whith usefull info like description, image and price and are showed on a map. There is an admin user who can act on any piece of information in the app and the users can reset their password if needed.

The app will be deployed soon on Heroku. A link to the live project will be provided.
